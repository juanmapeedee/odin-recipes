# HTML Foundations â€“ First Project

In this project, I will practice the basic structure of an HTML document, including how to properly use headings, paragraphs, and both unordered and ordered lists.  
The goal is to gain familiarity with HTML syntax and improve my ability to structure content on a web page clearly and semantically.

By completing this project, I will demonstrate my understanding of basic HTML elements and how to organize information effectively using lists.  
This is my first project on the platform *The Odin Project*.
